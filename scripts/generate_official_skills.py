        """
## When to use
User asks to open a PR, write a PR description, or summarize a branch for review.

## Steps
1. Run `git status`, `git log --oneline main..HEAD` (or `master..HEAD`), and `git diff main...HEAD --stat`.
2. Skim the full diff for user-facing behavior, risk areas, and tests.
3. Write:
   - **Title**: imperative, ≤72 characters
   - **Summary**: 2–4 sentences of *why* and *what*
   - **Changes**: concrete bullets (not \"misc fixes\")
   - **Test plan**: commands run and expected results
   - **Risk / rollout** if migrations or flags
4. Do not invent features absent from the diff. Link issue IDs if present in commits.
5. Offer paste-ready markdown; run `gh pr create` only if asked and `gh` works.

## Done when
User has a PR body they can submit without guessing what changed.

## When to use
Shipping a version and CHANGELOG must be updated.

## Steps
1. Read existing `CHANGELOG.md` (or scaffold Keep a Changelog).
2. Collect commits since last tag: `git log vX.Y.Z..HEAD --oneline`.
3. Classify: Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Deprecated / Removed.
4. Write **user-facing** entries (impact), not raw commit subjects.
5. Prepend `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and show the patch before writing to disk.

Listing pure refactors with no user or ops impact unless config/CLI breaks.

## When to use
User says ship, release, pre-flight, or cut a tag.

## Checklist
1. `git status` — list dirty files; confirm intentional.
2. Align version surfaces (pyproject, package.json, Cargo.toml, sync scripts).
3. Run the project's test command (pytest / npm test / cargo test / go test).
4. Run lint/typecheck if present.
5. Confirm CHANGELOG has this version.
6. List manual steps left: tag `vX.Y.Z`, CI, publish, desktop release.

## When to use
Version bump or \"is this major or patch?\".

## Steps
1. Diff vs last tag: breaking → major; feature → minor; fix → patch.
2. Prefer project sync script if present (`scripts/sync_version.py`, `npm version`, etc.).
3. Propose version + rationale; apply after confirm (or immediately if user already chose).
4. List files touched; remind CHANGELOG + tag after tests.
