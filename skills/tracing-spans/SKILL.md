# Tracing Spans

## Steps
1. Detect distributed tracing/tracing setup.
2. Span HTTP/DB/tool calls with useful attributes.
3. Propagate context across async/threads.
4. Sampling suitable for prod.
5. Verify in the project's trace UI.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
