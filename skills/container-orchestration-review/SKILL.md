# Container Orchestration Review

## Checklist
1. requests/limits present.
2. Sensible liveness/readiness.
3. non-root securityContext where possible.
4. Secrets not plaintext in git.
5. RollingUpdate / PDB for critical services.
6. HPA metrics sanity if used.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
