# Dev Environment Container

## Steps
1. Base image matching runtime.
2. postCreate install deps.
3. Forward ports; document usage.
4. Keep build time reasonable.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
