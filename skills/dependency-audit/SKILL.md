# Dependency Audit

## Steps
1. Detect lockfiles (package-lock, pnpm-lock, Cargo.lock, uv.lock, go.mod, poetry.lock).
2. Run ecosystem audit tools when present: `Node audit tools`, `Node audit tools`, `Python audit tools`/`uv`, `Rust audit tools`, `Go vulnerability scanners`.
3. Summarize **high/critical** first: package, issue, fixed version.
4. Recommend minimal upgrade path; avoid mass major bumps without tests.
5. Flag clearly abandoned deps when easy to see.

## Output
Severity table + recommended actions.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
