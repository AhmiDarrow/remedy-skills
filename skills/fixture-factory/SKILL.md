# Fixture Factory

## Steps
1. Find repeated test setup.
2. Introduce factories with overrides (factory helpers, etc. or simple helpers).
3. Keep defaults valid minimal objects.
4. Refactor a few tests to prove ergonomics.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
