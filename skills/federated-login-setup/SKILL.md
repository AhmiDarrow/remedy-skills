# Federated Login Setup

## Steps
1. Strict redirect allowlist.
2. PKCE for public clients.
3. Minimal scopes.
4. Secure token storage + refresh/revoke.
5. State/nonce CSRF protections.

## Operating rules
- Prefer **read-only** exploration before edits.
- Show commands run and their outcomes.
- Ask before destructive git, production changes, or secret access.
- Never commit or print live secrets.
- Stop with a clear blocker list if environment tools are missing.

## Done when
The user's goal is met **or** you report exactly what remains blocked and why.
